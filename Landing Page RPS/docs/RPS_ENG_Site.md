## EXHUME MICRO-TTRPG
EXHUME is an TTRPG with light and simple rules. It was designed with new players and a fast/free gaming style in mind. It's also my attempt to bring some “new school revolution” to the gaming table.  

Some of my reasons for creating EXHUME:  

+ I wanted to have a small game system that I could take and play anywhere using a pair of d6s.
+ A game system simple enough to keep recruiting new members for my gaming group.
+ Fast character creation, but like, really really fast.
+ An elf game that didn't just have combat rules.
+ A set of rules that was adaptable to use any adventure.
