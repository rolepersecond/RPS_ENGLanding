            <h1>EXHUME MICRO RPG</h1>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>EXHUME is a rules light fantasy role-playing game. It was designed with new players in mind and a fast-paced, free play style. It's also my attempt to bring some of the "new school revolution" style to the gaming table.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Some of my reasons for creating EXHUME:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to have a small game system that I could carry around, and play anywhere using just a couple of d6.</li>
                <li>A game system simple enough to keep recruiting new members for my gaming group.</li>
                <li>Quick character creation, but truly, really fast.</li>
                <li>An elf game that not only had combat rules.</li>
                <li>A set of rules that could be adaptable for use with any adventure.</li>
